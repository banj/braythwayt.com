The Biz Guy
===

Todd and Xena's B2B startup was almost ready to launch, and they got a sudden last-minute set of jitters. "What if we screw everything up due to our business inexperience?" They decided to talk to a Biz Guy. They asked around, and everyone thought Harlin was the smartest guy in any room. They met with Harlin.

"We were thinking," they started off, "About a promotion to help get the cash flowing. Our idea was to charge full price on the usual Net 30 terms, but offer 25% off to customers who pay within two weeks. Customers like to save money, and it would save us a lot of time chasing people for invoices."

Harlin seemed enthusiastic. "Great idea, but here's how it could be *even better*." He leaned forward and winked roguishly. "Offer them a *fifty percent credit* if they pay within two weeks." Todd and Xena exchanged confused looks. How could they afford to give fifty percent off? Harlin laughed. This was so simple! "Look," he explained, sketching the numbers onto the back of parking ticket, "If they owe $1,000 for the month and they pay the full $1,000 within two weeks, you give them a credit for $500. They use the $500 on the next month's $1,000 invoice and so they really pay you $1,500 for $2,000 worth of work. It's a 25% discount, but it sounds a lot better. And best of all, you get the first $1,000 right away, when you need it."
