An oft-quoted maxim is to never design for yourself because you aren't representative of your market, therefore you'll design a product only programmers could love, and so on.

I have observed a large number of product design failures, and I'm going to go out on a limb and disagree with this one. I have seen people "design for themselves" and do well. I have also seen people design for themselves and fail, not with a bang but a whimper.

My suggestion is that the failures aren't failures of doing a good job of designing for the wrong person. They're failures of doing a shitty-ass job of designing for "themselves." Good design is hard. The problem of programmers being shitty designers in average isn't caused by the fact that programmers have different needs than "ordinary people," the problem is that design is hard.

I see this when businesspeople design business software. They are the users and they *still* do a shitty-ass job! Nobody with a few years of consulting experience will claim that the users of software are magic experts at design. *We programmers are no different*.

And lest you want to argue, I suggest you peruse Github. Look at all the libraries and tools designed by programmers for programmers. How many are well-designed? I thought you'd come around to my point of view.

If you have a gift for good design, go ahead and design for whomever you want. If you create a well-designed product that meets your own distinctive needs, I bet other people would rather wrap their heads around a well-designed problem than wrap a poorly designed product around their heads.

But let's be clear: The hard problem isn't sorting out what needs the market has. The hard problem is designing good software to meet *any* set of needs whether yours or anyone else's.

And if you are a shitty designer? Don't sweat it. Design is a learnable skill. Go out and invest 10,000 hours in becoming a great designer. Don't assume some people have it from birth. Just recognize that the hard problem is good design and treat it like every other hard problem you've already conquered.

Good luck! I'm looking forward to seeing what you create.
