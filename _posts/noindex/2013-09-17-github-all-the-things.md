"Back in the day," Microsoft was a rapacious monster that consumed the software business, strip mining it for money. besides obvious stuff like illegally abusing its monopoly position or using secret pricing schemes to make competition impossible, it honed to perfection its ability to manipulate markets by "commoditizing its complements."

I think everyone knows this strategy, it means to hog all the value in a value chain my turning all of the complementary products into commodities. The classic example is how Microsoft went out of its way to commoditize hardware, thus all the value was in software. The hardware vendors are all the walking dead now, they played along.

Apple is happy to commoditize music sales, they resisted any price except 99c per track for that exact reason. They're doing the same thing to app sales on iOS and OS X, they want software to be a commodity. And unlike Microsoft, they will not tolerate a "Duopoly" with CPUs, they want silicon to be a commodity as well.

So GitHub:

My thesis is that we want to hog the value as well. We want to commoditize programming languages. We want to commoditize editors. We want to commoditize hosting. We want to commoditize every single thing about information except for this "graph" of what is connected to what and how it has changed over time.

Microsoft would do such a thing to make a ton of money. I think we should do such a thing because at this moment in time, graphs like this cannot be distributed. In theory you can have APIs and talk back and forth, but for practical purposes, having the whole graph in one place make sit possible to add enormous value.

For example, we shipped 3D diffs today. We'll ship [prose diffs](https://github.com/github/prose_diff/) RealSoonNow. The two aren't entirely unrelated: If someone is updating the model for a tool, they're probably updating the docs as well. Is the world really a better place if they look at tool diffs in one tool and doc diffs in another?

Knowledge of time and change and workflow with respect to information is The Thing for this decade. The dram used to be specialized tools, AutoCad for this, Emacs for that. But the moment you escape your desk and think of teams of people collaborating over time, you need a single overarching tool.

We will soon see the death of the CMS as a tool category. We will subsume it in all of its forms and guises. That isn't even a choice for us to make, our users will demand it of us. It will never make sense for a business to have one workflow for the words and HTML on their web site and another for the JavaScript powering its features. Having a single tool is a win for everyone, and it is our responsibility to provide it.
