That edition is not published by me. The person or persons publishing it are 100% responsible for setting its price, and if you choose to purchase it from them, they keep 100% of the money you pay. I have no influence over its copy or quality.

Instead of authorizing or overseeing these other editions, I choose to offer [JavaScript Allongé](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge) in three forms:

1. You can [read it online](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge/read) for free.
2. You can [read, download, and/or fork the markdown source](https://github.com/raganwald/javascript-allonge).
3. You can purchase the ebook from me on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge). Leanpub is the *only* way to purchase the book from me and see to it that I collect a royalty.

I have chosen to publish the book under a ["free-as-in-speech" license](http://braythwayt.com/2013/10/01/javascript-allonge-is-free.html). The bottom line is that if you have a copy of the book, *you* are free to distribute it for free, or for any price you like, whether less than I charge, or more.

The people behind that "edition" are using the freedom I granted them as they see fit. I do not judge them. If you choose to purchase from them, I do not judge you. However, [if you choose to exercise your freedom to buy the book from me for thirty bucks, I think that would be a beautiful thing](http://braythwayt.com/2013/10/04/the-freedom-to-pay-thirty-bucks.html).

Cheers, and thanks for your email!
