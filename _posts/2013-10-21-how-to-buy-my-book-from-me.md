I have chosen to publish the book under a [free-as-in-speech license](http://braythwayt.com/2013/10/01/javascript-allonge-is-free.html). The bottom line is that if you have a copy of the book, *you* are free to distribute it for free, or for any price you like, whether less than I charge, or more. I grant you that freedom willingly, because I believe that the principles of freedom are more important to me than 76 cents, or $4, or whatever it is people choose to charge.

The people behind that "edition" are using the freedom I granted them. If you choose to purchase from them, I do not judge you. After all, I made this possible when I decided not to tell them what to do with information that wants to be free-as-in-speech. However, [if you choose to exercise your freedom to buy the book from me for thirty bucks, I think that would be a beautiful thing](http://braythwayt.com/2013/10/04/the-freedom-to-pay-thirty-bucks.html).

Cheers, and thanks for your email!
