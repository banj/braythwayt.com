That edition is not published by me. The person or persons publishing it are 100% responsible for setting its price, and if you choose to purchase it from them, they keep 100% of the money you pay. I have no influence over its copy or quality.

Instead of authorizing or overseeing these other editions, I choose to offer [JavaScript Allong√©](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge) in three forms:

1. You can read the entire book [online](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge/read), for free.
2. You can read, download, and/or fork the [markdown source](https://github.com/raganwald/javascript-allonge), again, for free.
3. You can purchase the ebook from me on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge). Leanpub is the *only* way to purchase the book from me and the only way that I receive any compensation for your purchase.



Cheers, and thanks for your email!
