Author Ted Sturgeon was once asked why he wrote Science Fiction, when anyone could see that 90% of the genre was crud. Ted famously replied that "90% of everything is crud." This is now known as "Sturgeon's Revelation," and it's one of the most important insights to carry into any analysis of people and the things we do.

> I repeat Sturgeon’s Revelation, which was wrung out of me after twenty years of wearying defense of science fiction against attacks of people who used the worst examples of the field for ammunition, and whose conclusion was that ninety percent of SF is crud.[1]
> Using the same standards that categorize 90% of science fiction as trash, crud, or crap, it can be argued that 90% of film, literature, consumer goods, etc. are crap. In other words, the claim (or fact) that 90% of science fiction is crap is ultimately uninformative, because science fiction conforms to the same trends of quality as all other artforms.—[Ted Sturgeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_Law)

For example, recently my friend-at-a-distance (and excellent [author](https://shiprise.dpdcart.com)) Avdi Grim wrote about the dynamic of startups trawling for labour and using the word "passion" to mislead people into thinking that 80+ hour weeks creating the next mobile photo-sharing social network is a noble cause.

Obviously, 90% (or 99% or 99.9%) of the companies looking for "passionate" people are full of shit. And 90% of the people calling themselves passionate programmers aren't really passionate in the true sense of the word. How does Sturgeon's Revelation help us with this? It tells us that *it's ok for 90% of companies and 90% of programmers to be wrong about passion*. This is normal. 90% of everything is crud, including 90% of the beliefs about passion.

Someone else pointed out that in his experience, passion is a bad thing for a programmer, that it can be counterproductive and/or ruin lives. I know this to be true, I consider myself a passionate programmer, and it is a very expensive value to hold.

Sturgeon's Revelation to the rescue again: So what if 90% of the people who are actually passionate are unproductive to their employers and/or colleagues? 90% of everything is crud, that's ok.

I'll say it again: **It's ok for some group of people to be 90% crud**. This is the normal case.

### can passion be used as a hiring filter?

Let's turn to a practical matter. If 90 of the passionate programmers are crud, perhaps we shouldn't hire any passionate programmers? This seems to make sense. If someone's sitting in an interview wearing a "90% chance of crud" tee shirt, why wouldn't you defenestrate them without further delay?

The answer is easily explained with basic statistics. Doctors are reluctant to order tests for rare conditions. The reason is, if a condition is rare, the chance that you have the condition is much lower than the chance that the test will give you a false positive. So the doctor insists that there be other indications pointing to the condition before ordering the test. The doctor only orders the tests when the likelihood of the patient actually having the condition dominates the likelihood of a false positive.

Now in a world where 90% of everything is crud, 90% of the people sitting in every interview are crud whether they're passionate or not. When interviewing, being a good hire is a rare condition! And as such, all tests ("Are they passionate?" "Do they resemble someone I admire, namely me?") are dangerous to take out-of-context.

Let's try it. We advertise for a job with a web form, and we ask programmers whether they are "passionate." We'll make the (unrealistic) assumption that they answer truthfully. If we get 100 responses, of which ten are worth interviewing, and one is worth hiring, what happens if we discard every applicant who answers "Yes" to the question "Are you passionate?"

Well, the more passionate people you have, the more trouble you're in. If 50% of the people answer "yes," You end up with 50 applications. The fifty you threw way contained 45 cruddy people and 5 good people. The fifty that remain contain 45 cruddy people and 5 good people. You just cut your chances of hiring the one good person in half.

Of course, people who discriminate aren't trying to cut their chances in half. They're trying to throw away 50 applications and be left with all ten good people, or maybe 9 good people out of fifty. So what's wrong here?

What's wrong is this: **The observation that 90% of passionate programmers are crud is not helpful unless you can also say that programmers who aren't passionate are non-crud. And that simply isn't true.**

There's plenty of crud to be had amongst people who are in it only for the money, or are moderately enthusiastic, or whatever point you may pick along a continuum from "actively hostile to passion" to "indifferent" to "passionate."

Here is the bottom line:

### 90% of everything is crud

We are in an industry where 90% of *everything* is crud. 90% of the programs. 90% of the programmers. 90% of the companies. 90% of the tools. [90% of the books](https://leanpub.com/u/raganwald). 90% of the blogs. It's crud everywhere you look.

When you realize this, you realize that negative indicators like "passionate" or "uses tool-I-don't-respect" or "has funny accent" or "works-for-evil-company" are useless. *The only indicators that matter are the positive indicators, the ones that correlate strongly with being non-crud.*

And I'm sorry, we are all entitled to believe that 90% of the companies advertising for passionate people are crud, and we're all entitled to believe that 90% of the passionate programmers are crud. But nobody has established that not advertising for passionate programmers correlates with being a good employer, and nobody has established that not being passionate correlates with being a good programmer.

Therefore, Sturgeon's Revelation tells me that passion is like science fiction: 90% of it is crud, and that's ok.
