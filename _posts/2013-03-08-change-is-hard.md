It's easy--very easy--to dismiss simpler, "cut down" products as being trivial. And they usually are trivial and absolutely no threat to the 800 pound gorillas in any market. Even if you're sincerely trying to evaluate a new product, it's hard to look at it for what it is and not judge it in comparison to what you already know and love.

For example.

I love my 11" Macbook Air. After hefting it and carrying it around in my shoulder bag, I find Macbook Pros to be clunky. And when their fans start up, I don't care how many cores are running my Jasmine specs, I feel irritated. It's a great computer.

I also have an iPad. I bought one the first few minutes they were available to be ordered. We now have Retina iPads that are wicked fast in comparison. I like my iPad and I think it's a real revolution. I've even used it to program with Dropbox, a bluetooth keyboard and an ssh client to a remote system for staging my server code.

But it's not that might lighter than a Macbook Air, and it is a terrible pen client, so I never got addicted to writing on it with a capacitive stylus the way I became addicted to writing with my old Toshiba Portegé Tablet PC.

I like it for what it is, the greatest web browser I've ever used. And as a bonus, it runs all these other handy apps as well. But it is not a replacement for most of the things I do on an iPad.

### undersized, underpowered, lame

I recently had a short-lived experience working in a medium where it was important to preview my work on an iPad. My iPad is slow and suffering whenever Apple releases a new version of iOS. I worry that Apple will brick it one day the way they bricked my iPhone 3, so I bought an iPad Mini for work purposes. As a bonus, I figured, it would be a better device for watching movies and TV shows in bed with Air Video.

I got a lot more than I bargained for.

It's smaller and therefore much more portable. There's a tipping point of sorts, when a device gets small enough that you start carrying it even when you don't plan on using it, "just in case." Phone cameras are like that, at a certain point they're good enough that you use the phone instead of a camera because it's good enough and you always have it handy.

My iPad Mini is good enough for a bunch of things I'm used to doing on my Macbook Air. And I can carry it around with ease. Its battery lasts forever,[^apple] I can use it without recharging on a transatlantic flight. And in fact, I did use it both ways to Københaven and then again both ways to München.

I recently tried an experiment: I composed and edited my wroc_love.rb presentation entirely on the iPad. I disciplined myself to eschew the Air at all times. If something was awkward to do, I swore I simply wouldn't do it.

### learning a new thing

I find that although I talk a big line on my blog, in reality I can be conservative about new tools. I need to immerse myself in something to grasp it. With the iPad, I needed to immerse myself to appreciate developing a presentation using a touch screen instead of a keyboard and mouse.

The question I wanted to answer wasn't "can it be done," but rather, "can it be a *better* experience due to its unique format?"

I now can answer, yes, it can be a better experience. Not just because the iPad is right there whenever I have an idea, but also because the direct manipulation of my fingers suits a slide metaphor. I don't think I can say the same thing about writing a book yet, but there is a real "click" between working on a touch screen and working with slides. It feels right.

The wroc_love presentation went well, and I decided I would do it all over again for Web Rebels 2013.

### haiku deck

I grabbed a copy of Haiku Deck, a presentation app written *specifically* for the iPad. It is very opinionated: It only makes a certain type of presentation, and you have a very limited palette of options available.

![I have no idea what I'm talking about](/assets/images/i-have-no-idea.png)

But within its primary use case, it is very well designed and again it feels really right. And although you can export presentations in other formats, it is most at home right on the iPad or publishing your work directly to the web from within the app.

That feels like the future, editing things and publishing them to the web. Sending someone a file in an email feels so very last century to me.
