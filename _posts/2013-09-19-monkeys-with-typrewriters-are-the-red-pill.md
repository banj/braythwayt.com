### preamble

I have spoken at a few conferences in the last twelve months. For the most part, I avoid conferences. I'm shy and suffer from [Impostor Syndrome][^is]. Watching talks from accomplished people like Sandi Metz or Charles Nutter, I feel very intimidated. I have a real fear that someone will stand up and point out that I have nothing to say and I'm just babbling feel-good platitudes.

[^is]: The **impostor syndrome**, sometimes called **impostor phenomenon** or **fraud syndrome**, is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments. Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be.

The last two were particularly stressful. At [Nordic Ruby](http://braythwayt.com/2013/06/18/nordic-ruby.html), I talked about the possibility that Ruby is sliding into irrelevance, and although it looks healthy, it is in the same position as Microsoft a few years ago: Hamstrung by its own success. At [BaRuCo](http://www.baruco.org), I went further and questioned whether programming-as-it-is-spoke is also becoming irrelvant. Or more specifically, why the kinds of things that fascinate me are irrelevant.

I can't fault myself for sincerity: If a man suffers from imposter syndrome and he gives a talk about his own irrelevance, you can trust that the talk is from his heart!

So here are my thoughts, laid out with the metaphor I used in my slides.
