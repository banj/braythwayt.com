title: "Dear Toronto: You're Being Trolled"
---

Dear Toronto:

Do you ever have this nightmare? You're on the Internet, and you're trying to explain something sensible to someone, and they're heaping abuse on you? And when you start to make headway with a point, they sideslip into something totally irrelevant? And everything that is obviously subjective, is objective to them? And everything obviously objective is subjective to them?

I have this nightmare too, and sometimes during my waking hours. It's called being trolled. The primary characteristic of being trolled is when you are trying to achieve something positive, but the troll is simply trying to disrupt and hijack the conversation.

Trolls are toxic. You know that, I know that. We all run into them, like the "Men's Rights" jackasses who want to turn every story of abuse into a debate about how men get raped for their sperm and sued for child support and it's a double standard.

Have you got that person in your mind? Great. Let's review who they are and what they want:

1. They're angry with the world.
2. What they're doing right here, right now is disrupting people who the troll feels are their enemies.
3. Debate with a troll is a waste of time, because the troll wins when you waste your time.

The bottom line is that the troll's agenda is **sabotage**.

And so to Toronto.

### You've got trolls

Toronto is being trolled. Let's review the facts, shall we?

1. "Ford Nation" is angry with City Hall.
2. Ford Nation elected Rob Ford with the overt agenda of disrupting business-as-usual at City Hall.
3. Debate with Ford Nation is a waste of time, because Ford Nation wins when you waste your time.

This is why the crack video is a massive waste of time. Ford nation does not care that the Mayor does crack. Ford Nation does not care that the Mayor consorts with violent criminals. Ford Nation does not care that the Mayor rolls into work around noon. Ford Nation does not care that the Mayor used his staff for football duties. Ford Nation does not care that the Mayor looked the TV cameras in the face and lied. Ford Nation does not care that the Mayor cannot delegate or work with people.

Sometimes, Ford Nation will say that none of this matters, because it doesn't affect Mr. Ford doing his job as the Mayor. And people get their skirts in a tizzy. But it is a waste of energy debating this.

Ford Nation does not care that a man elected to lead has no leadership skills. Ford Nation does not care that a man elected to save money hasn't, in fact, saved money. This is because *Ford Nation doesn't really care if he leads or saves money*.

Ford Nation cares if he disrupts City Hall. Ford Nation cares if he disrupts Toronto.

Ford Nation are the Ontario equivalent of the Tea Party. Peel back the veneer, and you find someone who truly, deeply feels that "Toronto The Good" doesn't work. Who feels that it works for someone else. For downtowners, or liberals, or cyclists, or unionized employees, or something else.

Ford Nation thinks Toronto is all about *them*, and Ford Nation is angry about that. So Ford Nation elects a man who has but one job to do: Troll Toronto. Disrupt. Delay. Distract.

To Ford Nation, nothing getting done is a job well done.

And so, all this debate about whether he smokes crack is irrelevant. Suggestions of rehab are a complete side-show. Rob Ford doesn't need to go to rehab to get elected. He simply needs to do the job he was hired to do:

Make Toronto waste its time so that people angry with Toronto can sit back and enjoy a good trolling.
